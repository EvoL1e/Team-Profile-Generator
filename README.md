# Team Profile Generator

## Description

I was tasked with making a generator that would ask someone about their team. It would ask for info about the manager, engineer, and intern. It would ask for their name, id, email, github (for engineers), office number(for managers), and school(for interns). It would take the info into a constructor that will then append that info into the generator that will then create the html file for the user.
